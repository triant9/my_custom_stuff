//Someone asked me this years ago. it is possible to setup a source game to be the same as quake, but as the source engine's acceleration is framerate dependent,
//you MUST have a constant framerate in the source game, else it will fluctuate. First set sensitivity, m_yaw and m_pitch the same as quake.
//then in the source game set:
//m_customaccel 1 and
//m_customaccel_exponent 1.
//the last two settings are,
//m_customaccel_max = cl_mouseSensCap
//m_customaccel_scale = cl_mouseAccel * fps / 1000
//where fps is your framerate in the source game, not in quake.
//If m_customaccel_exponent is something other than 1, you cannot equate the two methods.
